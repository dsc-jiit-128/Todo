**Follow these steps:**

## 1. Fork this repository

**Fork** this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.

## 2. Clone the repository

Now, clone the forked repository to your machine.
Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the **clone button** and then click the **copy to clipboard** icon.

Open your **terminal** and run the following git command:

```Git
git clone {url you just copied}
```

**_Note:_** Do not type the _curly brackets_ into the terminal

**For example:**

```Git
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/Todo.git
```

## 3. Create a branch

Change the repository directory on your computer.

```Git
cd Todo
```

Now, create a branch using ```git checkout``` command:

```Git
git checkout -b {your-new-branch-name}
```

**For example:**

```Git
git checkout -b new-todo-feature
```

## 4. Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Let say you have made some changes for ```index.html```. Save the file and add it to the working directory.

```Git
git add index.html
```

Now, commit those changes using the ```git commit``` command:

```Git
git commit -m 'Add a new todo list name'
```

## 5. Push changes to GitHub

Push the changes using ```git push``` command:

```Git
git push origin {your-new-branch-name}
```

**replace** ```{your-new-branch-name}``` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## 6. Submit your changes for review

Go to your repository on GitHub, you will see a ```Compare & pull request``` button. Click on that button.

You can write more details about your changes before you submit the pull request.

Finally, click on the ```Create pull request``` to submit your pull request (PR).
